  	<h3><a href="/blog//book-review-golden-son">Book Review - Golden Son</a></h3>
  	<span class="post-date">19 January 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>The Golden Son is the second book of The Red Rising trilogy by Pierce Brown. This book takes off two years after the end of events in Red Rising. I read this book immediately after finishing Red Rising. The Golden Son is a good sequel to Red Rising. Unlike the Hunger Games trilogy where each book got worse as the series progressed, this sequel is much better. The story is a as interesting as the first one. The writing exceptional.</p>

  	<p>The second book I read this year after Martian is also set on Mars. Haha.. Talk about variety. This book though is a sci-fi set in the dystopian future when man has conquered all of the solar system and is colonising different planets. I’ve enjoyed the book very much. Although, it does seem to be inspired by Hunger Games and Ender’s game this book can stand on its own. I liked this book so much, I read the sequel immediately after finishing this.</p>

  	<p>Wow, what a book! Amazing. Loved it all the way through. The pace never slackened, the plot never boring. Andy Weir pulled off a stunner. This book had me at Mars and it had me again at stranded alone on Mars.</p>

  	<p>Welcome to yet another year. 2014 was transformative for me. I’m hoping to continue what I started in 2014, the groundwork has been laid, now I just need to stick to the plan and execute it.</p>

  	<p>I’ve started so many blogs, so many times that I’ve lost count. Most of it might be because I was still trying to find myself. 
At this point, I think I am able to find myself, slowly, in bits and pieces. However long, slow and uneventful this has been I’m liking the process.</p>
