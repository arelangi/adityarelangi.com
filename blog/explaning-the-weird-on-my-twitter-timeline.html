		<h2>Explaining The Weird On My Twitter Timeline</h2>
		<span class="post-date">30 April 2016</span>

		<div class="content">
			<p>If any of you have in the recent past seen my Twitter timeline <a href="https://twitter.com/arelangi" title="arelangi">@arelangi</a> and are wondering what all the tweets are about, this post is for you.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Alright, I’ve built this simple program in Go, which basically hijacks a signal that the Amazon Dash button sends by sniffing for packets on the network. What does this have to do with my timeline you ask? Well, as well meaning as I am it’s been really hard for me to consistently work out and reading Dan Ariely’s books I figured that it’d be nice to have an incentive to working out. In this case the incentive being not shaming myself on my Twitter timeline.</p>

<p>For everyday I workout I am supposed to press the Amazon Dash button which signifies the program that I’ve worked out. If I fail to do so, the program tweets out the embarassing message you might’ve noticed on my timeline. I’ve put up a couple of checks in place to make sure that I can’t bypass this mechanism. The code is all open source and is available <a href="https://github.com/logzer0/godash" title="go dash">here</a> and <a href="https://github.com/logzer0/godashdaemon" title="go dash daemon">here</a> for anyone who wishes to check it out.</p>

<p>The talk I gave about this is <a href="http://adityarelangi.com/talks/2016/april/#1" title="talk">here</a></p>
