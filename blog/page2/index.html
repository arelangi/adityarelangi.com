  	<span class="post-date">11 January 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>The second book I read this year after Martian is also set on Mars. Haha.. Talk about variety. This book though is a sci-fi set in the dystopian future when man has conquered all of the solar system and is colonising different planets. I’ve enjoyed the book very much. Although, it does seem to be inspired by Hunger Games and Ender’s game this book can stand on its own. I liked this book so much, I read the sequel immediately after finishing this.</p>

  	<p>Wow, what a book! Amazing. Loved it all the way through. The pace never slackened, the plot never boring. Andy Weir pulled off a stunner. This book had me at Mars and it had me again at stranded alone on Mars.</p>

  	<p>Welcome to yet another year. 2014 was transformative for me. I’m hoping to continue what I started in 2014, the groundwork has been laid, now I just need to stick to the plan and execute it.</p>

  	<p>I’ve started so many blogs, so many times that I’ve lost count. Most of it might be because I was still trying to find myself. 
At this point, I think I am able to find myself, slowly, in bits and pieces. However long, slow and uneventful this has been I’m liking the process.</p>
