  	<h3><a href="/blog//blockchains">On Blockchains</a></h3>
  	<span class="post-date">17 December 2017 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>I think blockchains are a really important technology and are going to change applications are built. A lot of people have been trying to understand what they mean and whether they are missing out on all the crptocoin boom. This meant I’ve spent quite some time trying to explain how these things work to a lot of people. Given that there’s a lot of content that does a good job of explaining what blockchains are how they work, why they are important, I do not feel the need to write another blockchain 101 post. So, I’m going to link this post to all the links that I think would help in bettering one’s understanding of the blockchain.</p>

  	<p>This week the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/">United State Congress voted to let ISPs sell their consumers’ browsing history</a>. This is a change that nobody asked for and is a clear selling out to the lobbying efforts of cable companies.</p>
