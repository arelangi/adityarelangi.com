  	<p>A lot of application development these days has to do with connecting to APIs. This means however different the underlying service we all end up implementing the same authentication mechanisms over and over, which is why I decided to go ahead and implement a simple library in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/logzer0/vegeta" title="vegeta">vegeta</a></p>

  	<span class="post-date">17 September 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>Coomi Kapoor’s book The Emergency is something that I came across when I saw her <a href="http://www.newslaundry.com/2015/07/10/nl-interview-with-coomi-kapoor-part-1/">interview with Madhu Trehan on Newslaundry</a>. It was launched around the anniversary of the emergency. Let’s get the first things out of the way. This is a memoir. The prose is simple, easy to read and flows easily. This should be read more for attaining a historical perspective rather than as an exploration of the language.</p>

  	<h3><a href="/blog//the-importance-of-semantics">The Importance Of Semantics</a></h3>
  	<span class="post-date">09 September 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>The word <em>semantics</em> from the ancient greek is the meaning or the interpretation of a word, sentence, or other language form. It is important how we define events, the words we choose to portray things that effect our lives. The fact that we as a society fail at agreeing to define issues as they are is lamentable.</p>
