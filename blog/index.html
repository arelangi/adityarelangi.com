  	<span class="post-date">21 March 2016 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>A lot of application development these days has to do with connecting to APIs. This means however different the underlying service we all end up implementing the same authentication mechanisms over and over, which is why I decided to go ahead and implement a simple library in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, <a href="https://github.com/logzer0/vegeta" title="vegeta">vegeta</a></p>

  	<p>Here are my plans and goals for 2016. 2015 hasn’t been in terms of keeping up with the goals, I’m hoping 2016 is going to turn out better.</p>

  	<span class="post-date">17 September 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>Coomi Kapoor’s book The Emergency is something that I came across when I saw her <a href="http://www.newslaundry.com/2015/07/10/nl-interview-with-coomi-kapoor-part-1/">interview with Madhu Trehan on Newslaundry</a>. It was launched around the anniversary of the emergency. Let’s get the first things out of the way. This is a memoir. The prose is simple, easy to read and flows easily. This should be read more for attaining a historical perspective rather than as an exploration of the language.</p>

  	<h3><a href="/blog//the-importance-of-semantics">The Importance Of Semantics</a></h3>
  	<span class="post-date">09 September 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>The word <em>semantics</em> from the ancient greek is the meaning or the interpretation of a word, sentence, or other language form. It is important how we define events, the words we choose to portray things that effect our lives. The fact that we as a society fail at agreeing to define issues as they are is lamentable.</p>

  	<span class="post-date">09 September 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>Ta-Nehisi Coates’s letter to his fifteen year old son in the wake of acquittal of Michael Brown’s murderers is a masterpiece. This is by far the best book I read this year and I doubt if any other books I might read this year might beat it. I do not remember how I came across this book, where I heard or read about it, but I am glad that I did.</p>

  	<span class="post-date">08 September 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>I’ve never written anyone obituaries. Haven’t read many either. I do not know what the format is, if there is any. Should one be close to a person to write an obit? Should one know them intimately? Shared a coffee, had a conversation? I do not know. But I do wish to express a little about how I feel about a couple of great humans that passed away this year.</p>

  	<span class="post-date">08 June 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>Every human being has a right to privacy, given that we spend most of our lives online, maintaining that privacy in the digital world becomes even more important. The argument that one has to choose between privacy and security in a free world is inherently flawed. We cannot forget that privacy is freedom and a society that values security over privacy is not free at all.</p>

  	<h3><a href="/blog//book-review-golden-son">Book Review - Golden Son</a></h3>
  	<span class="post-date">19 January 2015 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>The Golden Son is the second book of The Red Rising trilogy by Pierce Brown. This book takes off two years after the end of events in Red Rising. I read this book immediately after finishing Red Rising. The Golden Son is a good sequel to Red Rising. Unlike the Hunger Games trilogy where each book got worse as the series progressed, this sequel is much better. The story is a as interesting as the first one. The writing exceptional.</p>
