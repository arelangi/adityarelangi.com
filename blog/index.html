  	<span class="post-date">19 February 2024 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>“I’ve got to be honest, you probably won’t get batting.” That was my first introduction to Lions. I was filling in an empty spot in the 11 just before the day of the game.</p>

<p>On the way to the ground Prasad told me his template for winning and Lions have been winning that season. Win toss, bat first, score 200. The opposition will cave under chasing pressure.</p>

<p>“What if we lose the toss?”</p>

  	<p>This week I decided to delete Linkedin. I’ve been wanting to do this for a while now, but haven’t had the courage to do it. Nothing changed as such except me deciding to bite the bullet.</p>

  	<h3><a href="/blog//blockchains">On Blockchains</a></h3>
  	<span class="post-date">17 December 2017 </span><br/><br/>

  	<p>I think blockchains are a really important technology and are going to change the way applications are built. A lot of people have been trying to understand what they mean and whether they are missing out on all the cryptocoin boom. This meant I’ve spent quite some time trying to explain how these things work to a lot of people. Given that there’s a lot of content that does a good job of explaining what blockchains are, how they work, why they are important, I do not feel the need to write another blockchain 101 post. So, I’m compiling a list I think would help in one’s understanding of the blockchain.</p>

  	<p>This week the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/house-vote-sj-34-isp-regulations-fcc/">United State Congress voted to let ISPs sell their consumers’ browsing history</a>. This is a change that nobody asked for and is a clear selling out to the lobbying efforts of cable companies.</p>

  	<p>I’ve recently come across a Hindi translation of the poem <em>so you want to be a writer?</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bukowski">Charles Bukowski</a>. The translation is done by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varun_Grover_(writer)">Varun Grover</a>. I felt like sharing the original piece in its entirety as I struggle to turn my own thoughts into words. Here it is</p>
