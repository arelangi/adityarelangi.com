			<p>Welcome to yet another year. 2014 was transformative for me. I’m hoping to continue what I started in 2014, the groundwork has been laid, now I just need to stick to the plan and execute it. 
<!--excerpt--></p>

<p>I’m afraid this is going to sound like a resolution post which would be the most clichéd thing to write on the first of a year. I’m coming back to writing after quite a long lull. Probably to continuous writing after around 8 years. Please bear with me as I try to improve presenting my thoughts.</p>

<p>One of the major reasons I started writing again is that writing requires clarity of thought and it is better to have my ideas and thoughts written somewhere so that I can come back later and learn from the past. Not just that, but writing requires discipline. It forces me to make a plan, set a time, formulate my thoughts, to know the proper vocabulary to express. Just reading at what I’ve written in this draft makes me feel bad. I hope that making a habit out of this will improve my writing over time and when I come back to this in an year, I’ll be able to see a clear improvement.</p>

<p>So, what will I be writing here? Right now, it will be about the things I read, listen and learn. Some of the things I can think of right now are software engineering, web and mobile development, algorithms, data structures, machine learning. I will also be writing about history here; not limited to any period or region, it will mostly be about anything I come across. I am  interested in seeing how varied it will be, the more I write. Another major chunk of the posts I can envisage is book reviews, I’ve read more than 52 books last year, one for each week. For this year I’m gonna take a different approach and read much fewer books, but these will be bigger and better quality wise. The one and the most important distinction will be that I won’t consider a book completed unless I write a review for it. Maybe I shouldn’t call them reviews, synopsis sounds like a better word for what I intend to do but let’s wait on the naming until I write a few. A final part of what I would like to write about is startups. Some of it learned, some of it through experience.</p>

<p>So that’s it folks. My high level plan for writing this year. Until next time. Ciao.</p>
