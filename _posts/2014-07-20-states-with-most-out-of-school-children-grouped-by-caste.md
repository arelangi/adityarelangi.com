We take a look at the states with the most out of school children between the ages of 6-17 for the period 2007-08. The data is from the planning commission website. You can access it [here](http://data.gov.in/catalog/out-school-children-6-17-years#web_catalog_tabs_block_10).

As the great social reformer Frederick Douglas said <em>&ldquo;Once you learn to read, you will be forever free.&rdquo;</em> Edcuation frees one from the shackles of poverty, the oppression of caste system and the inanity of superstition. It is imperative that India invests more in educating it's youngsters especially when we take into account the fact that India's median population will be below 30 for many of the coming years and will eagerly be looking for employment opportunities and rapid growth than it is currently experiencing now.

When we look at the out of school children across all social groups, it is apparent that Kerala does a good job when it comes to keeping kids in school. With only 3.1% children out of school, no wonder Kerala leads the country when it comes to the literacy rates according to the 2011 census. Before we attribute this to the communist rule in the state, one only needs to look at West Bengal to realize that it is not the case.

The southern states perform well, when compared to the central states but still have a long way to go. The beautiful of Himachal and Uttarkhand do a good job though not as good as Kerala. The western states remain wanting but the northeastern states appear to be doing quite well.

Let's delve a little deep into how different social groups are across the states.

The low percent of out of school children from the general category paints a decent picture across all the states. You might've noticed that Nagaland bucked this trend and has as many as 55.6% children out of school. In this case we need to consider that only 1.1% of Nagaland's populace is of general category and 96.7% come from Scheduled Tribes. We can observe Nagaland does quite well to keep almost 94% of children from Scheduled Tribes in schools. What remains wanting in the general category is the disparity between the sexes. More girls seem to be out of schools than the boys in all states but Kerala.

The percentage of OBC children out of schools across all states is much worse when compared to the children of general category. It is sad to see that the percentage of OBC children out of schools is much larger even in OBC majority states like Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Andhra Pradesh. Especially in Andhra Pradesh with several of the state government schemes aimed at OBCs. Just as in the case with the general category children, even among OBCs fewer girls attend schools than boys.

The numbers for the scheduled castes do not lighten hearts. More number of SC children seem to be out of school than the OBC kids. This difference is stark especially in Punjab with almost thrice as many SC children out of school when compared to the general category. When we take the case of Uttarkhand though, there are twice as many OBC kids out of school than the kids from the SC community. Although the data for all the northeastern states is unavailable, the ones with the data seems to be doing well, this is because there is only a small percentage of SCs in the northeast. The SC girls like the other groups seems to lagging behind the boys when it comes to being in school.

Data for the out of school children from the ST category is not available for all the states. But for the ones we do let's take a closer look. At first glance Tamil Nadu seems to be doing terribly but only 0.8% of Tamil Nadu's populaces constitutes Scheduled Tribes. What is a matter of concern is the high percentage of out of school children in Maharastra. With 8% of it's population being STs, Maharastra ought to do a better job at bringing these kids and keeping them in schools. Rajasthan is another state that needs to take more measures to keep the ST kids in schools. Keeping in trend with all the other social groups, fewer ST girls seems to be attending school. This is nowhere more apparent than in the state of Orissa. With a quarter of it's population belonging to the scheduled tribes, this great Kalinga land is found wanting.

The amount spent on education as a percentage of total central government expenditure has reduced to 9.98% during the UPA rule. With such a small amount invested in our future, it is no wonder that the data looks so bleak.

What the greek philosopher Diogenes said 2500 years ago - <em>&ldquo;The foundation of every state is the education of its youth&rdquo;</em>  still stands true. Hope our leaders remain cognizant of this fact
